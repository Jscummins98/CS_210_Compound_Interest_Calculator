# CS_210_Compound_Interest_Calculator

This program simulates a bank account's growth over time with interest compounded monthly. It first asks the user to enter an initial desposit amount, a monthly desposit amount, an interest percentage, and a number of years. It then displays two charts in the console. The first chart shows the total balance at the end of each year with only the initial desposit being compounded. The second chart shows the total balance at the end of each year while factoring in the monthly deposit.
